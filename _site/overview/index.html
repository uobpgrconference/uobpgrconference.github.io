    <p><strong>Date and time:</strong> Tuesday 07 May 2020, 9:00AM – 07:40PM<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Luton Campus Centre, Postgraduate building, Luton, United Kingdom</p>

<p>There are certainly promising developments and innovations in the developing research works across different disciplines. Ongoing research brings contributions and insights achieved by various researchers in the public and private organisations, such as universities, companies, and laboratories. Significant advancements are achieved in both academic and professional environments, as well as a mutual benefit between academics and professionals gets created through affiliation and collaboration programs among them. At every discovery or progress achieved by one or another, there are new findings that unlock a door on a new journey. In every discipline, what is newly known often indicates imprecise ideas about the unknown volumes of knowledge we have yet to discover, but incrementally. Each increment is infinitesimally small comparing to the unknown knowledge, and still requires a research journey into the unknown.</p>

<p>A first step into the journey to the unknown starts by finding and asking questions we have no answers for. In this direction, there have been interesting open projects that establish a database for a reverse encyclopaedia: collecting things we know we don’t know on philosophy, science, mathematics, and all the universe (i.e. Reversopedia).</p>

<p>As it has always been a supportive environment to promote its research output by encouraging and organising research events, University of Bedfordshire is delighted to host and welcome all research students to file their research papers on Journey into the Unknown.</p>

<p>A wide range of research fields where researchers may be analysing data or specimen, observing events or phenomena, or performing interventional studies, presents tremendous opportunities for examination, discussion and constructive feedback. Research schools and departments are all invited: science of technology, engineering &amp; mathematics; art &amp; media- related research; social sciences; business &amp; management; and all health-related and laboratory-based research. Researchers from other universities are welcome to present their research thesis or papers to a welcoming and friendly audience, which may help shed some light on further improvement areas.</p>

<p>The conference will consist of contributed talks, contributed workshops, and invited talks on a wide variety of methods and problems in this area, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business &amp; Management Advancements</li>
  <li>Tourism, Hospitality &amp; Place Branding</li>
  <li>Law &amp; International Legal System</li>
  <li>Scientific and Technological Advances</li>
  <li>Decentralised Technologies</li>
  <li>Equality Promotion</li>
  <li>Security, Privacy and Ethical Issues</li>
  <li>Culture, Identity and globalisation</li>
  <li>Global Warming, Environment &amp; Sustainability</li>
  <li>Political and Geopolitical Challenges</li>
  <li>Global Peace and Stability</li>
  <li>Innovation and R&amp;D Advances</li>
  <li>Global Education and Learning Concerns</li>
  <li>Global Health and Healthcare Challenges and Issues</li>
  <li>Global Employability and Joblessness</li>
  <li>World Food and Agriculture Concerns</li>
  <li>Current Issues in Art and Media in the World</li>
</ul>

<p>The primary goal for this conference is to facilitate community building; with hundreds of new researchers beginning projects in this area, we hope to bring them together to consolidate this fast-growing area of the above themes into a healthy and vibrant subfield.</p>
